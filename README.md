# Template Inputter
**Tempin** is a template filler program that first asks for the path to your template file. </br>
This program then looks for user provided flags around your desired names and variables,</br>
indicating the names or variables you want changed in your template file. Specifically,</br>
it parses your template file's text, finds your flagged words, maps the flagged words </br>
to the your provided input(s) and then writes the updated text to a new file in the same directory. </br>

Additionally, it asks to save the path to a user given name to reduce start up time inputting the full </br>
to your template file. The saved paths are placed in a file called *templateFileNames.txt* which represents </br>
the data storage of your file paths and their given names.
