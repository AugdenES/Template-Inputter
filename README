## Template Inputter ##
This program looks for flags indicating the names or variables you want changed in your template file. <br>
Specifically, it parses your template file's text, finds your flagged words, maps the flagged words <br>
to the given user's input(s) and then writes the updated text to a new file in the same directory.
